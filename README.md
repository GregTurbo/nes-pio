# nes-pio

NES/SNES controller comms library using the RP2040's PIO

## Usage

~~This library is designed and tested to work with system clock set to 130MHz for the PIO clock divider to be correct.~~

You can add this library in `lib_deps` if using PlatformIO (tested with arduino-pico core) or add as a git submodule if using Pico SDK.

Autogenerated API documentation can be found [here](https://jonnyhaystack.github.io/nes-pio/)

Code examples for usage of each API can be found [here](examples/)
